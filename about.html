      As a developer, I tend to lean towards code architecture best practices,
      performance, and other technical aspects, distancing myself from the
      design side of things whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p class="about__paragraph reading-width">
      As a person, I'm perfectionistic and demanding of myself, but at the same
      time, easy-going and open-minded, always ready to help with any issue you
      may have. In addition, I have a master's degree in psychology, bringing a
      holistic approach to dynamics in the team. I also love music and even
      produce some of my own.
